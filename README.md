All Sucess Criteria Met 

## WWW
* I'm happy with how it looked and it is simple and intuitive to use.
* My Solution was similar to the design and component based.

## EBI
* Due to not taking the time to initality plan the solution, it lead to code being rewriten.
* Next time plan not only the funcitonality but also how it looks and read the brief carefully.

I relied too heavily on components, which makes other elements of the form more difficult to expand on such as dates and validation.
